==================

A location-aware web application that displays arrival times for nearby bus and lightrail lines.

Note that this application is under heavy development.


buscatcher in text mode
-------------------------

create a script that looks like this:

  #!/bin/sh
  curl -qLF "location=$*" http://buscatcher.sitr.us/location 2>/dev/null | lynx -dump -stdin | perl -pe 's/^(\s+\*)/*/; s/^(\s+)/  /g'

and then run a command like this:

[orz:~] % buscatch "SE Taylor & Grand"
  Stops near your location
  * SE Grand & Taylor StopID: 11483 distance: 0.018 miles
  + 6 M L King Jr to Jantzen Beach arriving in 8 minutes
  + 6 M L King Jr to Jantzen Beach arriving in 12 minutes
